# Ukko

*Ukko* the Finnish god of the weather, and the skies. The highest of the pagan gods, and resembled Thor with a mighty axe to control lightning.

As an application that was created to notify its users of inclimate weather within a time window. For example the times surrounding going to and from work so you know when you need to leave before getting caught in the rain. Nobody wants to arrive to work wet, and with Ukko you can do so without ads. Nobody likes ads.

## Getting Started

The Ukko project uses the following technologies:

* [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms)
* [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)
* [Refit REST Library](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit)
* [Splat](https://github.com/reactiveui/splat)
* [ASP.NET Core WebAPI 2.X](https://github.com/aspnet/Home)

To keep the developers happy please use the  conventions and guidelines throughout the application. They are very grumpy creatures.

* [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
* [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [White House Web API Standards](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards/blob/master/README.md)

The getting started guide is still currently in progress and will later have basic environment details. Until then hang tight and thank you for your interest in our humble project.
